// Let's imagine that we want to write a flashlight application.
// It will have two states: on and off. It will also have day and night light buttons.
// In the model, we will hold the state of the flashlight.
const flashLightModel = {

};
// When the user turns on the flashlight, the isOn field should be set to true, which will be the responsibility of the controller.
